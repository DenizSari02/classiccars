1968 was an exciting year for Corvette aficionados as the third generation made its entrance. Sporting a new body style and a refreshed interior, the third generation or C3 'Vette would continue right up to the 1982 model year, with several improvements along the way. If you'd like to experience the excitement that many will have felt way back in 1968, this 1968 Chevrolet Corvette L79 that we've got on sale is one great way to do so. A 67,500-mile car, it's reportedly received quite a bit of refreshment and rejuvenation to keep it going. The red paint job on this 1968 Chevrolet Corvette L79 is as fresh as they come, reportedly performed this year. Furthermore, you don't need to worry about damaging the fresh paint because it's protected with a ceramic coating to ensure that it stays lustrous for many more years. We're also told that this 'Vette has received a new front end, windshield wipers, power window system, lights, and tires. The undercarriage is also said to have received a sandblasting and black coating. Inside, this 1968 Chevrolet Corvette L79's tan interior looks in exceptional condition. Two seats are on offer, with a few creature comforts, including a new air conditioning unit as well as the aforementioned new power window system. You can enjoy some sun and sky by removing the twin targa roof panels or crank up the retro-modern aftermarket Bluetooth-capable stereo system. There's even a Custom Autosound 6-CD changer in the trunk. We also spot a set of new floor mats with the Chevrolet bow tie motif embossed within. This 1968 Chevrolet Corvette L79 packs the high-performance 327ci V8 called the L79. Rated for 350hp from the factory, it sends drive to the rear wheels through a 4-speed manual gearbox. The current owner reports a slew of new parts, including a new clutch, water pump, alternator, gas tank, carburetor, valve cover gaskets, and battery. New stainless steel brake calipers have also been fitted to ensure adequate stopping power under all conditions.

                In 1964 I purchased from an insurance company, a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette convertible that had been stolen and stripped.  (Vin# 40867S103144) There was also some body damage.  My father owned a very prestigious auto body repair shop where I worked.  Over the next five years I installed the following:
                Custom exhaust system with cutouts
                Aluminum four speed transmission
                Custom dashboard
                Custom upholstery
                Custom seats
                Custom steering wheel
                Custom body
                I converted the body from a convertible to a hardtop with a removable roof.  The roof when not installed fits behind the seats.  The body was completely custom built and not a kit body.  There are no other vehicles like this one.  I retained all of the Corvette inner panels and door mechanisms.  The steering, suspension, windshield, drivetrain are all standard Corvette and parts are readily available.
                I built the automobile to be driven on the street and not a show car.  I did however enter it in several shows where I took first place.  Because of work related issues I drove the vehicle less than 300 miles when I parked it in a barn and it has not been driven for over 50 years.
                The car will require work to be driven.  The body is in excellent condition but has some paint chips.  The tires are dry rotted and several have blown out. The aluminum wheels are pitted.  There is some upholstery mouse damage.  The rubber items like radiator and break hoses will have to be replaced.  Battery is missing.  The driver door glass is cracked.
                The vehicle is located on a farm 40 miles North of Pittsburgh Pa.  Moving it will require a flatbed tow truck.  Contact me if you have any questions. <br /> PRICE: $125.000
